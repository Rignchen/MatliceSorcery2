If you want to create a plugin feel free to do it

how to create a spell?
	in your spell's data, add a nbt "spell:_" and put an int bigger than 8

	then in #sorcery:spell, test if the score "#temp sorcery.use" match your value then launch the spell
	in #sorcery:title you can display the spell's name (if the score is the good one)

	if #sorcery:cost you can set #temp sorcery.mana to the amount of mana you want your spell to cost (if the score is the good one)
how to create a mana upgrade?
	if it's not an item, you can increast the player's score (sorcery.max_cooldown or sorcery.max_mana) don't forget to run the function sorcery:action/aura/calcul/ to update the aura

	if it's an item,
		max mana:
			add sorcery:{mana:{max:1b}} in the item's nbt
			add mana:x in the item's nbt, x beeing the amount of mana
		max cooldown:
			add sorcery:{mana:{timer:1b}} in the item's nbt
			add mana:x in the item's nbt, x beeing how much you reduce the max cooldown
how to make a craft?
	to craft something in the cauldron, use the function #sorcery:craft
	you should test if the storage sorcery:sorcery Ingredients have all the values you want

I'm not gonna teach you how to use the ultimate crafting table cause I didn't find a way to make it easy
if you still want to try the function to start the craft is #sorcery:advanced_craft
